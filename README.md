# Plant Disease Prediction using Deep Learning

 Mathematical model of plant disease detection and recognition based on deep learning, which improves accuracy, generality, and training efficiency. Firstly, the CNN model is utilized to recognize and localize the leaves in complex surroundings.
 
 ## Model used
   convolution neural network(CNN) a coustom model is used to classify the image
## The plant leafs and Disease  are used to train the model
